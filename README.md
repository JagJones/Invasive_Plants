### Goals

 - Read in data from two source types-
    1. The first df (df1, from a csv), lists invasive plant species by both common and scientific names as well as nativity.
    2. The second df (df2, also from a csv), has the same plants but lists an additional column of plant invasiveness. 
 - Combine the two dfs to create one main df (df_main).
 - Use seaborn to visually display plant stats.
 - Create a dictionary & function so a user can enter a plant name and see the details for that specific plant.


### Features

 - Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.
 - Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
 - Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used 
 somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function 
 should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to 
 where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code.


### Additional Features

 - Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, 
analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
