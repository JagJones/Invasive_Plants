***Invasive Plant Species of Kentucky***

This script uses pandas to read in two CSVs via https://www.invasiveplantatlas.org/list.html?id=24. The data is then cleaned up and organized. 

Seaborn is used to display visualizations to show the top 5 most plants, top 5 most invasive plant families, and then the most invasive plant family overall.

The way this project is written, it's used as a learning journal. There's a lot of lines with self explanatory comments that were needed for me to learn or work through a problem.
